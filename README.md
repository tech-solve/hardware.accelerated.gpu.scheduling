Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling enables more efficient GPU scheduling between applications. The GPU manages its own VRAM, rather than having it managed by Windows OS. This reduces latency & increases video playback performance.

If you want to use this feature, you need to first enable it either through the Windows Settings or the Registry Editor. But before that, make sure you are using the updated version of Windows and NVIDIA drivers. If you are using the AMD graphics driver then you probably might have to wait for a while until the driver supports this feature.

In this guide, we will show you how to enable Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling in Windows 11/10.

## Enable Hardware-accelerated GPU Scheduling

**To enable hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling using Windows 11/10 Settings, follow this procedure:**
